## Known issues and future improvements
* Cookies and session are not properly handled
* The button which sends requests for image processing can be abused and fill up and crash the server a timeout should be added for ~1 second
* The compression does not work properly with .png
* Shell and batch script can be written to automate the starting of the project in future
* Improve error handling for both front-end and back-end
* Add support for more extensions, currently the system supports .jpg, .jpeg and .png
* Add retention policy for the result images
* Improve the result retrieval (currently all result images are served as 1 big response to a GET request)

## Run the project
* Clone the repository somewhere
* Download and start XAMPP
* Copy the sql script located in image-processor-fe/sql and run it in phpmyadmin
* Copy the content of image-processor-fe and paste it into the htdocs directory located in the XAMPP installation directory
* Download kafka 2.11-1.0.0
* Go to <kafka_directory>/bin/windows for windows users (for UNIX users it is similar just the scripts are located 1 directory up in the tree) and execute the following commands:
    * zookeeper-server-start.bat ..\\..\\config\zookeeper.properties
    * kafka-server-start.bat ..\\..\\config\server.properties
    * kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic compression-topic
    * kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic noise-reduction-topic
    * kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic mirror-topic
    * kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic convert-gray-topic
    * kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic convert-black-n-white-topic
    * kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic edge-topic
    * kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic output-topic
* Start the image-processor-api application by running the main method in the ApplicationInitializer class
* Start the black-n-white converter application by running the main method in the Runner class
* Start the noise-reducer application by running the main method in the Runner class
* Start the image-compressor application by running the main method in the Runner class
* Start the output-consumer application by running the main method in the Runner class
* Go to localhost and start using the system
